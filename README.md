An attempt to use Convolutional Neural Networks for time series classification with stock data (BTC/USD 1H)

Trials with Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm (XGBoost) got up to 58% accuracy classifying the data with a 80, 20% split

I tried again with Convolutional Neural Networks and still got 58% accuracy. Well that wasn't anything good üö∂‚Äç
